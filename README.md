# Introduction

This bash script lets you create your GPG key, and configure your git client to sign all your commits.

Signing your commits allows your organization to clearly identify you, and thus mitigates the risk of manipulating unauthorized source code.

It has also been created to facilitate the implementation of the "Signing of code" security measure of the OWASP DSOMM model here: 

[Build: Signing of code](https://dsomm.owasp.org/activity-description?dimension=Build%20and%20Deployment&subDimension=Build&level=3&activityName=Signing%20of%20code )
